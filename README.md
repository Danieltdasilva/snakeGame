I am trying to recreate a game I loved as a kid.
The goal of the game was to score the most points. As you scored more points the got became harder.
It honestly reminds a lot about my coding journey: As I get better at coding it becomes harder.
Here's a picture of what it looks like:

With JavaScript, I was able to add the "snake food," the points, the snake itself, and I added a little music to add some touch to whenever you eat the food/gain the point.

I will eventually make changes to the game, resemble the original a bit more, maybe show the highest scores, make the snake move faster as you progress towards the game, etc.
I hope you enjoy the game as much I did making it.

I had help from an instructor and mentor, Rowlane Borges, at Manual do Dev.
